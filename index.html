    Insects are the largest group within the animal kingdom, with over a million described species and many more yet to be discovered. They belong to the class Insecta and are characterized by a three-part body structure: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Insects typically have six legs, antennae, compound eyes, and an exoskeleton made of chitin.

Insects play a crucial role in ecosystems. Many, like bees and butterflies, are pollinators, helping plants reproduce. Others, such as ants and termites, contribute to decomposition by breaking down organic matter. Some, like mosquitoes and flies, can transmit diseases, while others, like ladybugs and praying mantises, help control pest populations.

<p>
    <b>
        The Dilemma Orchid Bee, otherwise known as the Green Orchid Bee, is native to Central America but has also been spotted in Florida. 
        </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>

The bee, sporting a shiny metallic green hue, grows to about half an inch. The females collect pollen with baskets on their hind legs. The males, however, focus on attracting mates with fragrances from specific orchids, thus playing a critical role in pollination. 
</b>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>

Surprisingly, despite stings, their bite is less severe than the common honeybee's.

                    The European honey bee, also known as the Western honey bee, holds a unique place in history. This insect was domesticated some five millennia ago. To this day, beekeepers maintain this species for honey production and pollination. Thanks to human aid, it now thrives on every continent, Antarctica aside.

        Unlike its bee counterparts, the western honey bee boasts year-round colonies, which makes it a superorganism. Here, the colony, not the individual, takes precedence in reproduction.

        Interestingly, these bees have a modified ovipositor or stinger. Workers and queens wield it in hive defense. A popular misconception is that bees invariably die post-sting. In reality, the bee's mortality hinges on the victim, generally surviving unless it stings a mammal

                Twelve-spotted Skimmers are fast and agile. If given time to count, one would see a total of twelve black spots on all four wings of the male - three on each one. Between these black spots sit eight bright white spots that may even appear light blue. White smudges also appear next to the body. The female and immature males have the twelve brown-black spots, but not the white ones, so it is still acceptable to call them all twelve-spotted. Males have a powdery blue abdomen or 'tail'. The female tail is mostly black with a long yellow stripe on each side. Adults feed on small flying insects.

They strikingly pursue prey‚Äîhurtling forward, then pausing to reassess their path, possibly because their high-speed dashes blur their vision. One species can even run up to 125 body lengths per second. To stay safe during these sprints, they stretch their antennae rigidly to feel their surroundings1.
